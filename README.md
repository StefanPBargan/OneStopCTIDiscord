# OneStopCTI Discord Server
I'm excited to announce that I've created a new Discord server dedicated to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)! This server will serve as a hub for sharing real-time information about potential security risks from a variety of sources, including RSS feeds, Twitter, Reddit, and news articles.

My goal is to stay ahead of the latest cyber threats and improve our incident response capabilities through collaboration and real-time communication. I'll be leveraging Discord's text chat features to facilitate discussions and share information in real-time.

I invite anyone interested in CTI to join our server and help us stay ahead of the ever-evolving threat landscape. Let's work together to keep our networks and systems secure!

*The server is still a work in progress but with the help of the community I hope to create something awesome.
